**KANVAS**  is an IR (incident response) case management tool with an intuitive desktop interface, built using Python. It provides a unified workspace for investigators working with SOD (Spreadsheet of Doom) or similar spreadsheets, enabling key workflows to be completed without switching between multiple applications.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎲 **Case Management**
- **Built on the SOD (Spreadsheet of Doom)**: All data remains within the spreadsheet, making distribution and collaboration simple—even outside the application.
- **Multi-User support**: Files can reside on local machines or shared drives, enabling active collaboration among multiple investigators. File locking ensures that editing is properly managed and conflicts are avoided.
- **One-Click Sanitize**: Allows spreadsheet data—such as domains, URLs, IP addresses, etc.—to be sanitized with a single click, making it easy to share and store.

> [!TIP]
> The `SOD` template is slightly modified. Use the included `sod.xlsx` file from the package.

### 📊 **Data Visualization**

- 📌**Attack Chain Visualization**: Visualizes lateral movement for quick review of the adversary’s attack path. The re-draw options help display the diagram in multiple ways.
- 📌**Incident Timeline**: The incident timeline is presented in chronological order, helping investigators quickly understand the sequence and timing of the overall incident.
- **Export for Reporting**: The lateral movement and timeline visualizations can be exported as image files or CSV, allowing direct use in presentations or investigation reports.

>[!TIP]
> Ensure the following column names exist and match exactly if you're using your own spreadsheet.

### 👀 **Threat Intelligence Lookups**

- **IP Reputation**: IP reputation, geolocation, open ports, known vulnerabilities, and more using various API integrations.
- **Domain / URL Insights**: WHOIS data, DNS records, and more using various API integrations.
- **File Hash Insights**: Lookup binary file insights on various platforms based on hash values.
- **CVE Insights**: Information on known exploit usage based on CISA and other vulnerability intelligence sources.
- 📌**Ransomware Victim**: Verify if a customer or organization’s data has been published online following a ransomware attack.

>[!TIP]
> Configure API keys such as VirusTotal, Shodan, and others—before using the lookup features.

### 🛡️ **Security Framework Mapping**

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: Provides up-to-date MITRE tactics and techniques for mapping adversary activities.
- 📌**MITRE D3FEND Mapping**: Helps map defense strategies based on the identified ATT&CK techniques. This is especially useful when responding to an incident from a defender’s perspective.
- **V.E.R.I.S. Reporting**: Provides an interface to track VERIS data, which can be shared post-incident with various government entities and contribute to the Verizon Data Breach Report.

### 📑 **Knowledge Management**

- 📌**Bookmarks**: Offers a curated list of security tool, an up-to-date list of Microsoft portal URLs, and the ability to create custom investigation-specific bookmarks.
- **Event ID Reference**: Consolidates Windows Event IDs in one place, organized by categories like persistence, lateral movement, and more—making it easy to cross-reference during investigations.
- **Entra ID Reference**: Provides a searchable list of known and malicious Microsoft Entra ID AppIDs—useful for investigating Business Email Compromise (BEC) cases.
- 📌**Markdown Editor**: Provides an interface to create and update Markdown documents—ideal for note-taking or loading investigative playbooks during investigations.
  
> [!TIP]
> For easy access, keep all Markdown files in the `markdown_files` folder.
